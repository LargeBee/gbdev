# gbdev
Collection of GameBoy Z80 Programs (Made as a hobby, not all may be functional)

hardware.inc should be fine but you can find latest version of hardware.inc [here](https://github.com/gbdev/hardware.inc) 

Once [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) is installed, enter the directory of the program you want to build and run 
```
bash ../build.sh name-of-program
``` 
for example in the hello-world folder to compile the program to a .gb file you will run 
```
bash ../build.sh hello-world
```
without the extension

Makefile was taken from [Here](https://gist.github.com/tobiasvl/3ce2767391666fb93bbf55d79bc06bca)
